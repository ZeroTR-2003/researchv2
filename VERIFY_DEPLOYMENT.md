# ✅ Deployment Verification Checklist

## 🚀 Vercel Auto-Redeploy Status

After pushing the fix to GitHub, Vercel will automatically redeploy your site. This typically takes **2-3 minutes**.

### Check Deployment Status

1. Go to: **https://vercel.com/dashboard**
2. Click on your project: **researchv2**
3. Check the **Deployments** tab
4. Look for the latest deployment (should say "Building" or "Ready")

---

## 🔍 Browser Console Check

Open browser DevTools (F12) and check:

### Before Fix (Expected Errors):
```
❌ Failed to load resource: 404 (christuskirche-exterior.glb)
❌ Failed to load resource: 404 (heroes-acre-exterior.glb)
❌ Failed to load resource: 404 (windhoek-city-museum-exterior.glb)
```

### After Fix (Should Be Clean):
```
✅ No 404 errors for .glb files
✅ GLB files load (should see ~2MB transfer size)
✅ No Three.js errors
✅ Canvas renders successfully
```

---

## 📱 Mobile Testing

Test on mobile device or browser DevTools mobile view:

- [ ] Responsive layout works
- [ ] 3D models load on mobile
- [ ] Touch controls work for rotation
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Dark mode works on mobile

---

## 🎯 What Should Happen

### 3D Model Loading Sequence:

1. **Initial State:** Shows "Loading 3D Model..." text
2. **Loading:** GLB file downloads (~2MB per model)
3. **Rendering:** Three.js renders the 3D scene
4. **Interactive:** Model appears and rotates
5. **Success:** Smooth 60fps rotation

### Expected File Sizes in Network Tab:

| File | Size | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| christuskirche-exterior.glb | ~1.9 MB | ✅ 200 OK |
| heroes-acre-exterior.glb | ~1.13 MB | ✅ 200 OK |
| windhoek-city-museum-exterior.glb | ~1.78 MB | ✅ 200 OK |

## 🐛 If Models Still Don't Load

### Troubleshooting Steps:

1. **Check Vercel Deployment Logs**
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Deployments → Click latest deployment
   - Check for build errors
   - Verify build completed successfully

2. **Verify Files on GitHub**
   - Go to: https://github.com/ZeroTR-2003/researchv2
   - Navigate to `public/models/`
   - Click on a `.glb` file
   - Should show file size (1-2MB), not "Stored with Git LFS"

3. **Clear Browser Cache**
   ```
   Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+R (hard refresh)
   Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+R
   Safari: Cmd+Shift+R
   ```

4. **Check Direct File Access**
   - Try accessing: `https://your-site.vercel.app/models/christuskirche-exterior.glb`
   - Should download a 1.9MB file
   - If 404, deployment hasn't synced yet

5. **Wait for Propagation**
   - Vercel CDN may take 1-2 minutes to propagate
   - Try in incognito/private window

---

## ✨ Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:

- ✅ All 3 landmark pages load
- ✅ All 3 3D models display and rotate
- ✅ No console errors related to GLB files
- ✅ Models can be interacted with (rotate, zoom)
- ✅ Fullscreen mode works
- ✅ Performance is smooth (60fps)
- ✅ Dark mode works throughout
- ✅ Mobile responsive

---

## 📊 Performance Check

Use Lighthouse (Chrome DevTools):

**Expected Scores:**
- Performance: 85-95
- Accessibility: 90-100
- Best Practices: 90-100
- SEO: 95-100

**Note:** First load may be slower due to 3D model downloads (~18MB total). Subsequent loads should be fast due to caching.

---

## 🎉 After Verification

Once everything works:

1. Update `README.md` with your live Vercel URL
2. Take screenshots for documentation
3. Test on different devices/browsers
4. Share with reviewers/supervisors

---

## 📝 Quick Test Command

You can also test locally first:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Then visit: http://localhost:3000

If models load locally but not on Vercel, check Vercel deployment logs.

---

## 🆘 Need Help?

If models still don't load after following these steps:

1. Check `VERCEL_FIX.md` for technical details
2. Review Vercel deployment logs
3. Verify GitHub repository has actual files (not LFS pointers)
4. Try redeploying manually in Vercel dashboard

---

**Expected Resolution Time:** 2-5 minutes after push  
**Status:** Waiting for Vercel auto-redeploy
